# milleR

A few functions I packaged.

	dsLibs() - common Data Science libraries

	dynamic_name() - quickly generate code for automatically updating output file names by date.

	factorFix() - ensure matching features b/t train and test. Also numeric mean imputation for numeric columns.

	rm_cons() - drop constant features

	rm_ident() - drop identical features

	setdiff2() - bidirectional setdiff

and so on.
